# Climate-Change_Analysis

This repository demonstrates the use of **univariate** and **multivariate analysis** techniques in the context of **climate change data analysis**. These techniques help in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in climate-related datasets, such as temperature records, precipitation data, and atmospheric CO2 levels.

### 1. Univariate Analysis

**Univariate analysis** involves the examination of a single variable at a time. Its goal is to summarize and describe the data. 

### 2. Multivariate Analysis

**Multivariate analysis** involves examining multiple variables simultaneously to understand relationships between them. The goal is to detect patterns, correlations, and potential causal relationships among several variables.
